# crypto_trading_bot
Automated cryptocurrency trading bot. 

This connects to the [Binance](https://www.binance.com) API using the [python-binance](https://python-binance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. *If you would like to test this out you will need to have an account with [Binance](https://www.binance.com) and access to the API using your own API keys*.

### Important
This is part of a personal project to have a trading bot continuously active and making trading decisions based on technical indicators. It is purely for my own educational purposes to develop further knowledge about programming and data analysis in the context of a real-world problem, while also learning a little about trading along the way. **I do not claim that this is profitable**.
